        <p>I am from Mahabubabad district, Telangana state, India. I completed my Bachelor's in Information Technology from Malla Reddy College of Engineering and Technology. 
            I have 1 year of experience working as an Assistant Software engineer at Tata Consultancy Private Ltd. 
            Then, to improve my technical skill set, I made the decision to obtain a master's degree. Currently, I am pursuing my master's at Northwest Missouri State University major in Applied Computer Science. 
            I would learn how to construct sophisticated SQL queries and to maximize them through this course. My goal is to become a Full stack Developer as a full-time employee.
